  The Golden Foot trophy is home again! A rousing 7-5 win for the Footwork team
  over Mt. Eliza TC. A packed crowd watched the nail-biting final doubles which
  went to 10-8 in the tiebreaker. Incredible performance from the boys. We'll be
  back next year to defend the title on Mount Eliza's home courts.
